  sub?: string // optional second line (e.g. "PostgreSQL"); on a code node it trails as a `# …` comment line
  icon?: string // named lucide glyph key (see lucideIcons.ts); overrides the pattern's default glyph
  variant?: 'card' | 'tile' // 'card' (default): wide icon-left rectangle. 'tile': compact icon-over-label.
  // A CODE node renders as a small IDE-editor card — window chrome + a filename tab + gutter-numbered,
  // syntax-highlighted source — instead of a pattern card. `label` carries the source (newline-separated
  // lines); `filename` names the tab. Python is code-first, so most scenes are one big code card. Size
  // is computed from the content (longest line × line count) and fitView scales it, so it stays crisp
  // at 4K. Ignores `pattern`/`icon`; may still sit in a flow (edges route to/from it).

  // A node with `children` is a CONTAINER: the engine lays the children out inside it and sizes the
  // box to fit them (a labelled group). Children with no edges stack vertically. Lets a scene show
  // nesting — "AWS Cloud ⊃ services", a Region ⊃ its AZs — instead of faking peers as a flow chain.

  // Edges AMONG this container's children. With edges the children FLOW (longest-path) instead of

  // (children stack/grid per `cols`) when absent. Reference child ids only.
  edges?: SceneEdge[]
  // Direction of that child flow. 'TB' (top→bottom, default) or 'LR' (left→right — actor on the left,
  // targets fanned right) are the common two; 'BT' (bottom→top) and 'RL' (right→left) are the reverses

  // Override the arrow ROUTING for this one edge (which node faces it leaves/enters), independent of
  // the container/scene flow — e.g. two side-by-side nodes in a TB flow whose edge should run 'LR'.

  // elements match the rest of the deck. Resolution-independent: identical fraction at 1080p and 4K.
